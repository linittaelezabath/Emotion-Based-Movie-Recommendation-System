### Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Python-based application that detects a user’s facial expressions through a webcam using OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers and recommends movies based on the detected emotion.
The system performs real-time face detection, identifies simple emotional cues such as smiles and eye patterns, and maps the detected emotion to a predefined movie database.
