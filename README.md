### Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Python-based application that detects a user’s facial expressions through a webcam using OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers and recommends movies based on the detected emotion.
The system performs real-time face detection, identifies simple emotional cues such as smiles and eye patterns, and maps the detected emotion to a predefined movie database.
The application uses OpenCV for computer vision tasks, including face, eye, and smile detection, and the random module to provide varied movie recommendations.
Once the user quits the webcam feed, the program outputs a list of recommended movies corresponding to the final detected emotion.


### Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)


### How to Run

Install dependencies using pip install opencv-python.
Run the Python script.
Allow webcam access.
Press q to exit and receive movie recommendations.
